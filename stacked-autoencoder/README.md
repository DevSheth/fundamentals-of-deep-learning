# Stacked Autoencoder
- refer `Autoencoder.py` for class implementation.
- refer `part1a.py` for `part1b.py` for for dimension reductions using PCA and AANN.
- refer `part2.py`, `part3.py` and `driver.py` for training code of indivdual and stacked autoencoders.
- refer `ds1_mlffnn.py` and `ds2_mlffnn.py` for training code of normaml multi-layer feed forward neural networks.
- deltails regarding the assignment and the results can be found in the report.
